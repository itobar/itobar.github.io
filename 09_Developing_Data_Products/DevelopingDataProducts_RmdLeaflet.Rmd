## 1. Project Goal and Methodology

One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, I use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to predict the manner in which the participants did the exercise. At the end, the best prediction model is used to predict 20 different test cases.
